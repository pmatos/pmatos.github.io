Announcing a new racket package [`html-examples`](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/html-examples) to convert an [`examples`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/eval.html#(form._((lib._scribble%2Fexample..rkt)._examples))) block to HTML for inclusion in your own page.

```shell
$ raco pkg install html-examples
```

[`html-examples`](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/html-examples) is a simple, one function, package to convert an [`scribble/example`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/eval.html) block into HTML. I tried to find a pre-existing function to do this but all I could do was to get scribble to generate a whole page together with a bunch of assets for the page to render properly. Therefore I created this package which fishes out the correct `div` from the page generated by `scribble`, so you can typeset beautiful examples on your web page like:

As usual, documentation can be [found online](https://docs.racket-lang.org/html-examples/index.html) and code can be found in the [project's page on GitHub](https://github.com/pmatos/html-examples) where I am happy to receive any bug reports and feature requests you might have.
