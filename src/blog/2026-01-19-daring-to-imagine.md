It's hard to even imagine what things will look like in 2-3 years time.

I have been submerged in the day-to-day, pushing philosophical questions of the future aside. But when I do look up, I get the shivers. Here's what I see: A world where software materializes faster than we can read it — code blooming into existence like time-lapse flowers, flawless and strange. Where errors dissolve before we even notice them, perfection arriving faster than doubt. 

A world whose full implications I can barely grasp, like standing at the edge of something vast and inevitable, my stomach dropping, my mind racing to catch up.
