Sub-agents suffer from context isolation, leading to significantly higher token consumption and the inability to share context between tasks, which often results in contradictory code outputs. The article presents alternative approaches, such as the \"Service Expert Method\" and the \"Claude Flow Framework,\" which aim to overcome these limitations by managing context more effectively. It suggests that the future of AI-assisted development lies in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of sub-agents and adopting appropriate context management strategies, rather than forcing sub-agents to handle tasks they are not designed for.",

Fowler cautions that surveys on the effects of AI may be misleading, as they often fail to account for the different ways developers are using LLMs, such as direct code editing rather than just autocomplete. He also expresses uncertainty about the future of programming and the potential impact of LLMs, encouraging experimentation and sharing of experiences. Additionally, Fowler discusses the inherent risks of LLMs, such as their tendency to hallucinate and the increased attack surface they create for software systems, particularly in browser-based applications.",

The author used an iterative workflow of writing a plan, prompting the LLM to complete tasks, and then reviewing and refining the work, rather than relying on the LLM to generate a complete solution.\n\n2. The author found that LLMs excel at \"whiteboarding\" - generating initial solutions, but struggle with iterative improvement based on subjective quality metrics. Providing a clear specification and test suite helped guide the LLM's development.\n\n3. The author shares lessons learned about architecting the project for testability, using a \"snapshot\" function to easily regenerate the test suite, and the trade-offs of maintaining a custom tool built with an LLM.\n\nThe post provides practical insights into using LLMs for coding tasks and highlights the importance of engineering the right development workflow and tooling to leverage their strengths.",
