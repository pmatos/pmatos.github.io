      "summary": "This article discusses the author's experience with using Bash scripts and minimal CLI tools instead of a full-featured MCP (Multi-Command Protocol) server for common browser automation tasks. The author argues that for specific use cases like web frontend development and web scraping, a simple set of CLI tools can be more effective and composable than a feature-rich MCP server. The article provides examples of how the author has implemented a suite of browser automation tools using Puppeteer Core and Bash, demonstrating that this approach can be efficient and easily extensible for an agent.",

It highlights two key challenges with traditional MCP integration - tool definitions overloading the context window and intermediate tool results consuming additional tokens. The post then explores how code execution with MCP can address these issues by allowing agents to load only the tools they need and process data in the execution environment before passing results back to the model. This approach can result in significant reductions in token usage and latency, while also providing benefits around privacy and control flow.",

      "title": "Some thoughts on LLMs and Software Development",
      "summary": "This article by Martin Fowler provides some thought-provoking insights on the impact of large language models (LLMs) on software development. Fowler cautions that surveys on the effects of AI may be misleading, as they often fail to account for the different ways developers are using LLMs, such as direct code editing rather than just autocomplete. He also expresses uncertainty about the future of programming and the potential impact of LLMs, encouraging experimentation and sharing of experiences. Additionally, Fowler discusses the inherent risks of LLMs, such as their tendency to hallucinate and the increased attack surface they create for software systems, particularly in browser-based applications.",

      "title": "Vibe Coding Terminal Editor",
      "summary": "This blog post discusses the author's experience developing a terminal-based code editor using a language model (LLM) like Claude. The key points are:\n\n1. The author used an iterative workflow of writing a plan, prompting the LLM to complete tasks, and then reviewing and refining the work, rather than relying on the LLM to generate a complete solution.\n\n2. The author found that LLMs excel at \"whiteboarding\" - generating initial solutions, but struggle with iterative improvement based on subjective quality metrics. Providing a clear specification and test suite helped guide the LLM's development.\n\n3. The author shares lessons learned about architecting the project for testability, using a \"snapshot\" function to easily regenerate the test suite, and the trade-offs of maintaining a custom tool built with an LLM.\n\nThe post provides practical insights into using LLMs for coding tasks and highlights the importance of engineering the right development workflow and tooling to leverage their strengths.",

      "summary": "This article describes the author's experience of \"vibe coding\" - using AI coding assistants to co-develop a software project implementing algorithms to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The author, an experienced programmer with a PhD in AI, was impressed by the AI assistants' programming capabilities and ability to reason about the problem. The article compares the performance of different AI coding assistants and discusses the collaborative nature of the development process, which involved over 300 exchanges between the author and the AI. Overall, the article provides an insightful look at the current state of AI-assisted software development.",
