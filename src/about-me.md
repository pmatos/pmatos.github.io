# About Me

I'm Paulo Matos, a software engineer based in Nuremberg, Germany. I specialise in compilers and dynamic binary translation, working as a freelance consultant with [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/). My current focus is on [FEX-emu](https://fex-emu.com/)—a dynamic binary translator that enables x86 and x86-64 applications to run on ARM64 systems, primarily for the video game industry.

My work lives at the intersection of low-level systems programming and performance optimisation. There's something deeply satisfying about making software run where it wasn't originally designed to.

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me at the piano, out running, or in my sim-racing rig. I started learning piano in January 2022, knowing nothing beyond where middle C was, and gave my first public performance just eight months later. I'm a trained IRONMAN triathlete who completed several races between 2013 and 2019, though I stepped back from triathlon when COVID hit. These days I keep fit with running—most recently a half marathon in Mainz with my good friend Jesse Alama—and I'm still chasing faster lap times on the virtual track. I live with my partner and two children, and yes, I play more Fortnite than I probably should.

Feel free to reach out—I enjoy connecting with people working on interesting problems.
